# Baselines

The recorded score of the search, one row per phase. This file is the memory of
the project: it is how anyone can tell, six months from now, whether the clever
thing that shipped in Phase 5 actually helped.

**`node eval/run.mjs --baseline` reads the last row of the table below that has
numbers in it and fails the run if nDCG@10 has fallen more than 0.005 beneath
it.** Rows left blank are treated as not yet recorded and are skipped, so the
empty Phase 2 row costs nothing until it is filled in.

## How a row gets added

1. Apply the migrations, load the seed, and run `npm run eval:baseline`.
2. The run must exit 0. A run with a constraint violation is not a baseline; it
   is a bug report.
3. Copy the numbers off the "Overall" and "Slices" tables into a new row at the
   **bottom** of the table. Newest last.
4. `Commit` is the short SHA the numbers were produced from — `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
   with a clean tree. Numbers from a dirty tree are not reproducible and are not
   a baseline.
5. `What changed` is one line. Not a changelog: the single thing that moved the
   number, or "first recorded".

A number that goes down is recorded anyway, with the reason. The table is a
record of what happened, not a highlight reel.

## The rule that outranks all of this

**The golden set is never edited to make a score move.** If a change makes the
number worse, the change is wrong. Editing `eval/golden.jsonl` to rescue it
destroys the only instrument the project has. New queries may be *added* to
cover ground the set misses — and when they are, every earlier row below becomes
incomparable and the table gets a horizontal rule and a fresh start, with the
size of the set noted.

## Recorded baselines

| Date | Commit | Phase | Queries | recall@10 | nDCG@10 | Mean ms | p95 ms | Zero-result | What changed |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
|  |  | 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Per-slice detail

The headline number hides where the search is weak. Record the slices too — the
non-English slice in particular is the one Phase 4 exists to move.

| Date | Phase | Slice | Queries | recall@10 | nDCG@10 |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
|  | 2 | english |  |  |  |
|  | 2 | non-english |  |  |  |
|  | 2 | constrained |  |  |  |
|  | 2 | unconstrained |  |  |  |

> Only the first table drives `--baseline`. The parser reads columns by name and
> only accepts a table whose header carries both `Commit` and `nDCG@10`, so this
> one is ignored no matter what is filled into it.

## Targets each later phase has to clear

| Phase | Has to beat | Where the document says so |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 3 — vectors | Phase 2's nDCG@10 | `docs/build-phases.md` §Phase 3 gate |
| 4 — sentence understanding | Phase 3, especially the non-English slice | §Phase 4 gate |
| 5 — ranking | Phase 4, each of the three steps measured separately | §Phase 5 gate |
