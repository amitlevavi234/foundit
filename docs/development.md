# Working on Foundit locally

## Start the database

```bash
docker compose -f db/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
node db/apply.mjs --fresh --seed
```

That is a throwaway PostgreSQL on your own machine, on port 5433, holding
invented data. Its password is in the compose file on purpose.

### When Docker will not start

Run this and go and make a coffee:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\fix-docker-sockets.ps1
```

Docker leaves socket files behind when it is killed rather than shut down, and
Windows then cannot delete them, so Docker cannot start — it needs to remove
the old socket before binding a new one. **Rebooting does not help**: the files
survive a reboot. The script renames the folders containing them aside, which
works because renaming a folder does not require opening what is inside it.

**Do not press "Reset to factory defaults"** in Docker's error dialog. It does
not fix this, and it deletes every image and container you have.

## The server also runs PostgreSQL

Production lives there, not on the laptop.

### Two databases, one instance

| Database | For |
| --- | --- |
| `foundit` | production. Empty until Phase 9 deploys. |
| `foundit_dev` | development. This is the one you use. |

Both are configured from `research/08-postgres-selfhosted.md` §3.2, the CX23
profile: 512 MB shared buffers, `work_mem` 8 MB with `max_connections` 30, JIT
off, data checksums on, `pg_stat_statements` loaded. The container is bound to
`127.0.0.1:5432` on the server and nothing publishes it further.

**One departure from the researched config:** `archive_mode` is `off`. The
research turns it on with an `archive_command` that shells out to pgBackRest.
pgBackRest is not installed yet, and `archive_mode = on` with a failing
`archive_command` does not degrade gracefully — PostgreSQL keeps every WAL
segment it cannot archive until the disk is full. Turn it on in the same change
that installs pgBackRest, never before.

### Open the tunnel

```bash
ssh -N -L 5433:127.0.0.1:5432 founditops@167.233.217.138
```

Leave it running. Local port 5433 is now the server's database.

### Credentials, and the two roles

The application and the migrations connect as **different roles**, and this is
load-bearing rather than tidiness:

| Variable | Role | Owns | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `foundit_app` | nothing, no `BYPASSRLS` | the web app, `eval/run.mjs` |
| `DATABASE_URL_OWNER` | `foundit_owner` | the schema | `db/apply.mjs` only |

**There is deliberately no fallback between them.** If the app could quietly
reach for the owner connection when its own was missing, every row-level
security policy in the schema would stop applying on the day someone's
environment was misconfigured — and nothing would look broken. A missing
variable must be a loud failure instead.

The eval harness connects as `foundit_app` for the same reason: measured as the
owner, latency reads about four times faster than a visitor will ever see it.
That mistake is why the first Phase 2 baseline was withdrawn.

Locally, both are in `.env.local` and their passwords are the throwaway
literals from `db/docker-compose.dev.yml`.

On the **server**, the credentials were generated on the machine and live in
`/root/.foundit/db.env`, readable by root only. They have never been typed into
a chat window, an editor, or a file git can see. To read one back:

```bash
ssh founditops@167.233.217.138 "sudo grep '^POSTGRES_PASSWORD=' /root/.foundit/db.env | cut -d= -f2"
```

## Applying migrations

```bash
node db/apply.mjs            # apply what has not been applied
node db/apply.mjs --fresh    # drop the schema and apply everything
node db/apply.mjs --seed     # ...and load the development catalogue
```

Which migrations have run is recorded in `infra.schema_migrations`, not inferred
from the files, so running it twice is safe. It sits in its own schema rather
than `public` because every table in `public` must have row-level security
enabled and forced, and bookkeeping for the migration runner cannot satisfy
that without a permissive policy — which is the exact anti-pattern the
permission tests exist to catch.

`db/apply.sh` does the same thing through `docker exec` and needs the database
to be a container on the same machine. Keep it for that case.

## Running the search evaluation

```bash
node eval/run.mjs
```

It scores the golden set in `eval/golden.jsonl` and prints recall@10 and
nDCG@10. **The golden set is never edited to make a score move.** If the number
is bad, the search is bad.

## Rules that are not negotiable

- No real password, key or token in any file git tracks. Ever.
- Never disable row-level security, never connect as a superuser or as the
  table owner, never write a policy that evaluates to `true`. If one of those
  looks like the fix, you have found a real problem — stop and say so.
- The server never fetches a URL someone submitted.
